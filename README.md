# stopwoRds

An R package containing Lists of stopwords in a few languages.

The idea behind this package is to give the user control over the stop-word 
selection. The core `generate_stoplist()` function relies on 
`multilingual_stopwords()`, a large data frame derived from the current 
release of the Universal Dependencies Treebanks. We have included all languages 
whose corpora totalled above 10,000 tokens â€“ large enough to cover all common 
closed-class words, such as prepositions, conjunctions, and auxiliary verbs.
The data comes encoded in UTF-8. 

## Installation

Install the package directly from the GitHub repository:
